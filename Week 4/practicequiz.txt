Question 1
What is the first action Spark SQL's optimizer performs before processing your query? 
Answer: It checks the query against the metadata catalog to verify that the table and columns you're referencing actually exist

Question 2
Spark SQL can auto-optimize your query by reordering the sequence of commands so that it can process the data in the most efficient way. What is that stage in the optimization process called? 
Answer: Logical Optimization

Question 3
A cluster is a set of computational resources that power your query. Within a cluster, a driver breaks up and distributes work to the workers. What happens if one of the workers shuts down? 
Answer: Nothing really; the work will just be redistributed among the workers that are continuing to run. 

Question 4
The Spark UI contains a lot of visualizations about how your data is being processed and exactly what's going on within your cluster. 
In which area of the UI would you find a list of all the SQL queries that have been performed since your cluster started running? 
Answer: The SQL tab

Question 5
If you see that a column in the table you're working with begins with "p_", what does it likely indicate about the table? 
Answer: It is partitioned by that column

Question 6
What is Spark caching? 
Answer: It stores data in temporary storage across machines in your cluster.

Question 7
What does it mean to partition a table? 
Answer: It allows you to write subdirectories for the table in your file system
